# Tech-Blog

For this Assignment, we are supposed to give the user a prompt to either login or signin to the website, pulling login data if they attempt to login from the database, or storing it into the base if they choose to sign up. After words, we give the user the ability to add blog posts, or to comment, and we display those onto the main page. We also, when the user is signed in, give the user the option to sign out. Certain pages and interfaces are hid from the user, if they are not signed in. We store, user info, blogpost info, and comment info within databases.

For this assignment, I needed the assistance of chat gpt to help me through some errors and to help understand the logic from some of the code, from activities that we worked on through class. In the end, I still ended up with issues, because I was getting overwhelmed by the amount of files, and how to connect everything and where. I also need to work on understanding how to properly set up the handlebars pages.
